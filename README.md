# Tic-Tac-Toe Learning App

A Tic-Tac-Toe game built with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. This app isn't just for gameplayâ€”it's designed as a learning tool, allowing players to explore and understand optimal moves in Tic-Tac-Toe by playing against an unbeatable AI in impossible mode.

## Features

- **Move-by-Move Insights**  
  Each cell displays the move number, showing the order in which each player (user or computer) makes their moves. This helps players learn and analyze the sequence of moves in a typical game.

- **Difficulty Modes**  
  - **Easy**: Beginner-friendly, suitable for new players.
  - **Hard**: A moderate challenge for intermediate players.
  - **Impossible**: Powered by the **Minimax Algorithm** (recursive AI), making the computer unbeatable. This mode is perfect for learning the best moves at any stage of the game.

- **Undo Functionality**  
  A back button allows players to undo any move, making it easy to experiment with different strategies and see alternative outcomes.
